## Abstract

The Smart Learning Management System (LMS) is a web-based application developed using the Django web framework and SQLite3 database.

Students can create accounts, log in securely, browse and enroll in available courses, and provide feedback on the courses they undertake. Each course contains assignments. The administrator can manage the system through a backend interface, where they can add, edit, or delete courses, view registered students, track enrollments, assign course assignments, and monitor course feedback.
